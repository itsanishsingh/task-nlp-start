    "# Natural Language Processing\n",
    "NLP is a sub-field of AI and is created from fields like linguistics, computer science and AI. Here the task is for the machines to understand natural language and help them in solving a problem or better assist them through it in speech format. For example, helping people in ATM booths to better guide them through the interface. There are some tasks of NLP which are as follows:-\n",
